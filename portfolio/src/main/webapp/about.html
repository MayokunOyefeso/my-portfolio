                <p>
                    I was born in Lagos, Nigeria.
                    I am the first daughter of my lovely family, which consists of my dad, mum, three elder brothers, and a younger sister.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Growing up in Lagos shaped my optimistic perspective of people and life occurrences, because Lagos is diverse, colorful and full of life. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although, I am a bit reserved, I enjoy meeting new people, having conversations and learning. 
                    One of the things I am most fascinated by is the power of learning.
                    How the human mind can grasp information and a person can go from being ignorant about a subject 
                    to having knowledge about it in as little as minutes, that is the power of learning.
                    This is why, I am enthusiastic about learning from everyone around me and every situation I find myself in. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been mathematically inclined since I was a child. 
                    Hence, I decided to take classes preparing me for an engineering and technological field in my final years in High School.
                    Currently, I am a rising sophomore at the reputable Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was initially enrolled as a Mathematics major, but I decided to take on a double major in Computer Science 
                    and Mathematics after my first Computer class. This decision was spurred by my fascination and interest 
                    in the creation of technology that would positively impact my life, those of others around me and the world at large.
