        <p>
            Born in Lagos, Nigeria on November 10, 2001, Oluwamayokun Oyefeso is the first daughter of her family. 
            She is blessed with a loving family that consists of her dad, mum, three elder brothers, and a younger sister. 
            Growing up in Lagos shaped her optimistic perspective of people and life occurrences because Lagos is diverse, colorful and full of life.

        <p>
            Although, she is a bit reserved, Oluwamayokun enjoys meeting new people, having conversations and learning. 
            One of the things she is most fascinated by is the power of learning.
            How the human mind can grasp information and a person can go from being ignorant about a subject 
            to having knowledge about it in as little as minutes, that is the power of learning.
            Therefore, she is enthusiastic about learning from everyone around her and every situation she finds herself in. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Oluwamayokun has been mathematically inclined since she was a child. 
            Hence, she decided to take classes preparing her for an engineering and technological field in her final years in High School.
            Currently, Oluwamayokun is a rising sophomore at the reputable Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee.
        </p>

        <p>
            She was initially enrolled as a Mathematics major, but she decided to take on a double major in Computer Science 
            and Mathematics after her first Computer class. This decision was spurred by her fascination and interest 
            in the creation of technology that would positively impact her life, those of others around her and the world at large.
